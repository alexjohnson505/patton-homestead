        <td><p>The BOS will decide whether or not to form a non-profit and then, if approved, it will appoint a founding set of Board of Directors.  Three intial founding directors have been identified and it is likely that the BOS will engage a public outreach to solicit two more founding board members from the Hamilton community.  </p></td>

        <td>The Senior Housing</td>
        <td><p>CP Berry submitted a winning bid under an RFP to build 12 units at the propoerty.  The bid was discussed in detail and unanimously approved at the April 2014 Hamilton Annual Town Meeting.  The bid was for $1,000,000 for the land and another ~$156,000 to go toward the town's Affordable Housing Trust because of our inclusionary bylaw.</p><p>CP Berry currently has an application under review by the Hamilton Planning Board for a Special Permit for the twelve units of senior housing (0ver 55).  The housing is restricted by the Gift Agreement to be moderately priced, which has been interpreted by the BOS for new construction to be up to $675,000 per unit.  </p> <p> The Planning Board will require a super majority (5 out of 7) to vote to approve the Special Permit.  It is expected that the Planning Board's professional engineering consultant will be finished reviewing the developer's stormwater, septic, landscaping and lighting plans plans over the next few weeks (by mid April). The Planning Board will then continue with the Special Permit Hearings to consider the results of their professional review.</p>  <p> The Hamilton Board of Health has reviewed and approved the developer's septic plans.</p>  <p> The Hamilton Conservation Commission has reviewed and approved the developer's wetlands determinations and identification of the resource areas.</p>  <p> The appropriate State agencies have approved the developer's determinations and identification of the resource areas and has ruled that the proposed development is not a taking, and thus it preserves and respects the resource areas.</p> <p> The  chiefs of Hamilton's Police and Fire Departments have reviewed the plans and have determined that teh design is appropriate and sae as designed (Michael - please confirm).</p>  <p> The Hamilton Planning Board voted to accept the inclusionary housing payment of ~$156,000 in lieu of onsite construction of the units (not part of the developer's bid).</p> </td>
        <td>The PB must complete the Special Permit application hearings and decide whether or not to issue the Special Permit.</td>

        <td>The Open Space</td>
        <td>The Town has been working with Essex County Greenbelt to open up access to their land-locked property which is immediately off of the Patton's wood road that wraps around the back side of the property along the Ipswich River.  Once the designs have been completed, they will likely still need to be approved by the Conservation Commission.</td>
        <td>Once the riverwalk designs have been completed, then the plans will be permitted, costed out and then constructed.  It is currently anticipated that the construction of the riverwalk will be commenced this summer (2015). </td>    
        </tr>
         <tr>
        <td>The Recreation Fields</td>
        <td>When the town had the land surveyed topographically the lands that were initially identified as potentially for housing were determined to be heavily restricted by the required setbacks from the Ipswich River and from wetlans and other natural resource areas.  The Joint Recreation board had been considering (as part of the April 2012 discussion about whether the town should acept the gift of land) placing several recreation field on the plateau.  When the housing locations became geographically unfeasible the recreation board said that they could forego the recreation fields located specifically on the Patton Property , although they extremly hopeful that some of the resources generated from teh sale of those lands would be designated as available to help resolve the need for recreation fields elsewhere in the town.</td>
        <td>A warrant article is on the agenda of the upcoming April 2015 Hamilton Annual Town Meeting that would redirect eventual sale proceeds of the Patton Senoir Housing land (if the sale closes - if the Planning Board issues the expected Special Permit) to a Recreation Field Stabilization Fund.  That vote will require a 2/3rd majority.  <p>The Joint Rec Board would then use the designation of those public funds as leverage to start to private fundraising for recreation field solutions.  It is expected that the warrant article placing the funds into the Recreation Satabilization Fund would condition expenditures from the fund on having agreements in place with the H-W Regional Schools & with Wenham.</p> <p> Any  expenditures from Stabalization Funds always require a 2/3rd majority.</p> </td>
