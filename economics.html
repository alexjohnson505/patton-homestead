            </p>12 units at $675,000 each = $8,100,100 value x $17.40 per thousand (2014 tax rate) = $140,940 annually </p>
            <p>Excise taxes of 12 units at 1.5 cars X average value of $24,000 = $7,517 annually</p>

At $35,000 per year rate, the town has incurred $87,500 to carry the property so far. </p><p> Going forward, the town will increasingly shift a substantial amount of operating and carry costs to the non-profit, so the ongoing budgets will likely be less than $35,000. </td>

Of the $1,000,000 proceeds, $250,000 is obligated by the Gift Agreement to go to an endowment for the Homestead.  The remaining $750,000 was voted at April 2014 Town Meeting to go into a Stabilization Fund, which requires a 2/3rds vote of Town Meeting to be spent. </td>

As part of CP Berry's bid (in response to the RFP) they will contribute $156,480 to Hamilton's Affordable Housing Trust. This amount is slightly higher than the zoning bylaw requires, but the developer included $156,480 in the bid and has reaffirmed its commitment to the higher amount.</td>
